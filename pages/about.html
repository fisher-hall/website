<h2>The Cadillac</h2>
<p>
    Welcome to Coyle Hall, or as we refer to it with fondness, The Cadillac. We feel this nickname is befitting, not because our academic and athletic excellence rivals that of other halls (though we might argue that it does), but because our sense of community and togetherness finds no equal anywhere else on campus. From the Car Smash to the Funk, and everything in between, Coyle Hall believes in the importance of unity and inclusion. One encounter with any of our residents is all it takes to understand why the campus thinks of us as the Friendly Fishermen.
</p>

<h2>Dorm Culture</h2>
<p>
    Whether a First Year engineer or Senior finance major, every resident of Coyle Hall is a Fisherman. 
    In fact, the community in Coyle is so strong that friendships often bridge class year, major, dorm geography (4a vs. 1b), and the like. 
    Coyle is a tight-knit community where almost everyone knows each other by name.
    The men of Coyle build community through service, faith, athletics, and more. 
    Our signature events, in particular, the Regatta, are big parts of who we are and help to involve the entire dorm and campus community.
    Above all, Coyle Hall is a place of mutual respect. As such, every resident of Coyle is called upon to treat his brothers with respect and to live out the motto that “all are welcome in this place.”

<h2>Dorm History</h2>
<p>
    Founded in 1952, Coyle Hall has been the premiere residence hall on the campus of the University of Notre Dame for sixty-three incredible years. 
    Throughout its glorious existence, residents of the Cadillac of Dorms have strived to push the limits of dorm involvement, participating in a host of activities ranging from the fun and creative to spiritual- and service- oriented projects.
    Originally housing 156 seniors, Fisher Hall was dedicated by Sally Fisher to her late husband Fred Fisher, former member of the Board of Trustees. 
    At the time of construction, Fisher was only the 2nd dorm to have a social lounge. The dorm was renovated in Summer 2001, and was demolished in 2024 to make room for our new building, Coyle Hall.
    Fisher Hall has also housed its fair share of celebrities and Notre Dame legends. NBA stars LaPhonso Ellis (’92) and Orlando Woolridge (’81) once walked our halls. The one and only Regis Philbin (’53) called Fisher Hall home as well. And the legend among legends, Joe Montana (’79), is proud to call himself a Fisherman.

<h2>Fisher to Coyle Transition</h2>
<p>
    In 2024, the University announced that Fisher Hall would be demolished and replaced with a new building, Coyle Hall, in 2026. 
    While the new dorm is built, the Coyle Community (formerly Fisher Community) is residing in Zahm Hall, a former men's dorm.
    As the hall community undergoes the transition from Fisher to Coyle, many aspects of the dorm culture are evolving to match. 
    To be clear, however, the Fisher/Coyle community is as strong as ever. The dorm is growing in size but still has consistently retained its close-knit community. 
    As new mascots and mottoes are chosen, the essential traditions of Fisher, The Regatta, Car Smash, and Fisher Funk, as well as others, are being carried into Coyle Hall.
    As part of this transition process, current and incoming students all have the opportunity to share feedback and grow the new dorm culture through surveys, town halls, and various discussions and opportunities throughout the year.
    We can't wait to welcome everyone to Coyle Hall, and we are excited to see how the Fishermen continue to grow and thrive in this new chapter of our history!

<h2>Building Information - Zahm Hall</h2>
<p>
    Our current building, Zahm Hall, is one of the most centrally located dorms on campus. Located on North Quad, the dorm is a one-minute walk to North Dining Hall (across the quad), The Golden Dome/Main Building (east of the dorm), and LaFortune Student Center (LaFun) (south of the dorm). 
    Our neighbors are Cavenaugh Hall (our sister dorm), Keenan Hall (men's dorm), and we share the quad with Stanford Hall, Farley Hall, and Breen-Phillips Hall.
    North Quad is also home to Stonehenge, the best fountain on campus, and Haggar Hall, an academic building. 
    <br>
    Zahm Hall houses a mix of double, single, triple, and quad (four-man) rooms. The majority of incoming Fishermen will be placed in doubles, with a few shared three room quads.
    Each floor has a lounge and common space with a TV, couches, microwave, sink, and more. Certain floors also have study rooms, and there are two communal bathrooms on each floor.
    The basement in Zahm is the primary hang-out space for Fishermen, complete with a pool table, ping-pong table, foosball, study spaces, large TV and couch seating, fully equipped Gym, kitchen, and Ellie's Deli, our own sandwich restaurant. The basement was recently renovated and is air-conditioned!

<h2>Giving Back</h2>
<p>
    Charity is a central part of life in Coyle Hall. 
    Every year, residents commit themselves to making a difference, whether that be on campus, at home, or around the world. 
    In recent years, Fishermen have worked to help St. Adalbert's School in South Bend, a partnership that has greatly benefitted both parties. 
    Over the past 2 years, the hall has raised $12,000 for the school through 
    a series of hall led events, funds that were used to refurbish the St. A's gym and hospitality room. 
    Overall, Coyle Hall finds charity to be part of its identity, as it helps us to bring ourselves to each other and our community.
