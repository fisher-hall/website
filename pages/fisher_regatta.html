    Amount raised for St. Adalbert's by the 2021 Fisher Regatta

<h5><br><br>After losing the 2020 Regatta to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Fisher community rallied and executed the 2021 Regatta, which raised more money than ever before for St. Adalbert’s and can fund the construction of a fence for the safety of their students.<br><br></h5>

<h2>The Regatta</h2>
<p>
    The Regatta is known as the largest, most successful, and most outrageous signature event on campus. The regatta is a one-on-one boat-racing tournament on St. Mary’s Lake, and each boat entered must be home-made. Most dorms field at least one boat, and other non-dorm boats compete as well. Past years have seen everything from giant pirate ships to floundering Styrofoam rafts to floating basketball courts. 
    Last year, two Fishermen won the Regatta's men's event, and the tradition will continue as the hall transitions to Coyle. Last year’s regatta saw two new boats for Fisher Hall: a speedy plywood canoe and a giant party-barge. The Regatta draws over a thousand participants and spectators, with food, merch, music, and great vibes all day. Ranked as one of ESPN’s Top 100 college events, the Regatta is one of the biggest reasons why Coyle is known as the Cadillac of Dorms. YA GOTTA REGATTA!!!
    <br> <br>
    Of course, we forgot to mention the infamous Regatta Hawk, a legendary tradition known across campus, where Fishermen all shave their hair into mohawks to promote dorm unity and the spirit of the Regatta.
